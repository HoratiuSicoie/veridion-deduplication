# Veridion Product Deduplication

This project addresses the **deduplication of product records** that contain noise, inconsistencies, and redundancy. It includes:

- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data cleaning
- 🧠 Local deduplication experiments using notebooks
- ⚡ Scalable deduplication with Apache Spark (in progress)

## Notes
The implementation inside src/ is designed to scale to large datasets, but still requires further optimization:

Caching intermediate results between stages (especially after TF-IDF)

For now, the Spark implementation runs locally and may need tuning for performance on large datasets.

## 🔧 Future Improvements
Add evaluation metrics for deduplication performance (precision, recall)

Additional similarity metrics (e.g. Jaccard, Levenshtein)
